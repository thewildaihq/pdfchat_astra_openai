## How to Contribute

We aim to keep the process straightforward and collaborative. Here are a few guidelines to help you get started:

1. **Follow Existing Patterns:** Our codebase is structured to ensure clarity and consistency. When adding new features or fixing bugs, please adhere to the existing patterns and coding styles. This helps maintain code quality and makes it easier for others to understand your contributions.

2. **Use Helper Functions:** Whenever possible, reuse existing helper functions and methods. This not only saves time but also ensures consistency across different modules and functionalities.

3. **Formatting:** While there are no strict formatting rules, we recommend using `black` for Python code to maintain a clean and uniform codebase.

4. **Testing:** While our GitHub Actions might include tests for internal use, don't worry too much about them when submitting your contributions. We'll handle any issues related to test failures.
